For this weeks assignment we are tasked to re-create a weather dashboard using the Open Weather API, the general gist of the task was to get the user input and then query the API to get information returned back as a object, then display that information in a way the User can plan there trip. I also used Moments.js for the dates and time. The acceptaince criteria was that the user chosen city must display the Date, City Name, a Representation of the weather condition with an Icon, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and the Uv Index that is to be color coded depending on the Value. The user also wants to see the 5 day forcast of that area in brief detail. The user can also see all the searches made in a history tab and are clickable to display the information.

The task was great practice for Dynamically updating the HTML and Css through JavaScript and the use of Jquery. i like that it is finally tying all parts of web development into one product.
